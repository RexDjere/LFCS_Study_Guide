#### User Accounts

There are a few reasons to have individual user accounts:
* Providing each user with their own individualized private space.
* Creating particular user accounts for specific dedicated purposes.
* Distiguishing privileges among users.

One special user account is for the **root** user, who is able to do anything on the system. To avoid making costly mistakes, and for security reasons, the root account should only be used when absolutely necessary.

Normal user accounts are for people who will work on the system. Some user accounts (like the **daemon** acount( exist for the purpose of allowing processes to run as a user other than root.
