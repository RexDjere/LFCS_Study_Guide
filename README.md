### Command Line
#### Creating Files Without Using an Editor

There are two standard ways to create a file directly from the command line and fill it with content.

The first is to use *echo*:

    $ echo line one > myfile
    $ echo line two >> myfile
    $ echo line three >> myfile

As will be covered in a later section:

    >  --> redirect output of a command to a file
    >> --> append new output to an existing file (if exists)

The second is to use *cat*:

    $ cat << EOF > myfile
    > line one
    > line two
    > line three
    > EOF
    $

Both techniques will produce [this file](1.sh).

#### sudo

*sudo* allows users to run programs using the secuirty privileges of another user, genrally root (superuser). 

If your system does not already have sudo set up and enabled, you need to do the following steps:
* As the superuser, create a configuration file to enable the user account to use sudo. Typically, this file is created in the `/etc/sudoers.d/` directory with the name of the file the same as the username. For example, let's say the username is "student". You can create the configuration file for "student" by doing this:

`# echo "student ALL=(ALL) ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/student`

Some distributions will complain if you don't also change permissions on the file by doing:

`# chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/student`
